## ℹ️ About

The main goal of this project is to provide a base template for the generation of a production-ready REST API made with `Node.js`, `Express` and `Typescript`. The idea is to avoid having to configure all the tools involved in a project every time it is started and thus be able to focus on the definition and implementation of the business logic.

> 📣 This is an opinionated template. The architecture of the code base and the configuration of the different tools used has been based on best practices and personal preferences.

### 🚀 Quick start

- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  # or
  make install
  ```

- Start database container:

  ```bash
  make start/db
  ```

- Start cache container:

  ```bash
  make start/cache
  ```

- Generate Prisma Client:

  ```bash
  npm run prisma:generate
  ```

- Start project in development mode:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- Start project in production mode:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

- Open the following URL to interact with the API using Swagger UI:

  ```bash
  http://localhost:5000/api/docs
  # Sample username and password: janedoe / 123456
  ```

## 📋 Features

- Built using [Express Framework](https://github.com/expressjs/express): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
- Built using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): Next-generation ORM for Node.js & TypeScript | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite & MongoDB
- Built using [Ts.ED](https://tsed.io/): Ts.ED is a Node.js Framework on top of Express/Koa.js. Written in Typescript, it helps you build your server-side application easily and quickly. If you want to start a complete out-of-the-box project or fully customize it yourself, Ts.ED will guide you there!
