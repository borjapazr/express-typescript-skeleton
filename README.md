## ℹ️ About

The main goal of this project is to provide a base template for the generation of a production-ready REST API made with `Node.js`, `Express` and `Typescript`. The idea is to avoid having to configure all the tools involved in a project every time it is started and thus be able to focus on the definition and implementation of the business logic.

> 📣 This is an opinionated template. The architecture of the code base and the configuration of the different tools used has been based on best practices and personal preferences.

### 🚀 Quick start

- Start project in development mode:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- Start project in production mode:

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

## 📋 Features

- Built using [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- Built using [Express Framework](https://github.com/expressjs/express): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
- Built using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): Next-generation ORM for Node.js & TypeScript | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite & MongoDB
- Built using [Ts.ED](https://tsed.io/): Ts.ED is a Node.js Framework on top of Express/Koa.js. Written in Typescript, it helps you build your server-side application easily and quickly. If you want to start a complete out-of-the-box project or fully customize it yourself, Ts.ED will guide you there!
- JWT authentication and role based authorization using custom middleware
- OpenAPI definition
- Fully configured logger with [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) and [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)
- Unit, Integration and E2E tests using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
- Formatting with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [Spell check](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell)
